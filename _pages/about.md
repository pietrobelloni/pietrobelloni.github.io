This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni. Currently, I am a researcher (Italian RTDa) at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/) (UniPd).

Main research interests:

Also, I'm a proud member of [GLASS](https://sites.google.com/view/laboratoriodistatisticasociale/), a laboratory of social statistics, created and run by young Italian researchers.

I took (badly) all the pictures you'll see in this website. And how about some [music](https://pietrobelloni.github.io/music/)?
