This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni. Currently, I am a PhD Student at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/).

My research focus on epidemiology and medical statistics, especially applied to pharmacoepidemiology, public health and cancer data. I also have fun with projects about data science, data mining, and natural language processing. Recently, I joined [Tatonetti's lab](https://tatonettilab.org/) at [DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) to develop innovative techniques for drug safety. I am also one of the developers of [`faers.db`](https://ubesp-dctv.github.io/faers.db/), a library to provide an R interface to retrieve, merge, and tidy the FAERS database.
