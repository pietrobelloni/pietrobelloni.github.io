This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni, PhD Student at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padua (Italy).

My research is about epidemiology and medical statistics, especially applied to drug safety, public health and cancer data. I also have fun with projects about data science, data mining, and natural language processing.
