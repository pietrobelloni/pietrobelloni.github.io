This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni. Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/) (UniPd). My research is focused on epidemiology and medical statistics, especially applied to pharmacoepidemiology, public health and cancer data. I also have fun with projects about data science, data mining, and natural language processing.

Recently, I joined [Tatonetti's lab](https://tatonettilab.org/) at [DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) to work on innovative techniques for drug safety. I am also one of the developers of [`faers.db`](https://ubesp-dctv.github.io/faers.db/), a library to provide an R interface to retrieve, merge, and tidy the FAERS database. Previously, I worked as a statistician at the [European Institute of Oncology](https://www.ieo.it/en/), where I provided statistical support to cancer physicians and researchers at the Department of Experimental Oncology.
