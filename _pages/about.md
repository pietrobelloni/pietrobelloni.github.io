This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni. Currently, I am a PhD Student at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/).

My research focus on epidemiology and medical statistics, especially applied to drug safety, public health and cancer data. I also have fun with projects about data science, data mining, and natural language processing.
